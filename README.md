# Excel Projects - Data Jobs Analysis

Two Excel projects analyzing salary and skills data for data science roles, built while developing proficiency in advanced Excel features.

## Projects

| Project | Skills Used | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| [Salary Dashboard](Salary_Dashboard/) | Formulas, Charts, Data Validation | Interactive dashboard exploring salaries by role, country, and job type |
| [Skills & Salary Analysis](Skills_Salary_Analysis/) | Power Query, Pivot Tables, DAX, Power Pivot | Analysis of which skills correlate with higher pay |

## Dataset

Both projects use a dataset of real-world data science job postings from 2023, including:
- Job titles and descriptions
- Salary information (yearly and hourly)
- Locations (country-level)
- Required skills

## Tools

- Microsoft Excel (365)
- Power Query for ETL
- Power Pivot for data modeling
- DAX for calculated measures

## What I Learned

- Array formulas with multiple conditions for dynamic filtering
- Building interactive dashboards with data validation dropdowns
- Power Query for cleaning and transforming messy data
- Creating relationships between tables in Power Pivot
- Writing DAX measures for custom aggregations

## About

These projects were completed as part of Luke Barousse's Excel for Data Analytics course. While following the course structure, I built each project hands-on to reinforce the concepts and develop practical Excel skills relevant to data analyst roles.
